The five of us are dancing. That day was incredible. Next to me, you can see my friend Alvy. Alvy is smiling. He is standing in one foot. The girls are my best friends.Two of the girls, Delma and Magda are wearing funny hats. Magda, the tallest girl, is wearing a strange pink hat. Delma is wearing a hat that has the colors of the Colombian flag. Some people around us are walking, talking or sitting down, but everybody is enjoying the festival.

In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. In this picture I am standing next to my friend Lily. Lily is showing me something she bought, but I am not paying attention to her. I am looking at the camera. My friend William took the picture. I am wearing a cap, but Lily is wearing a hat. We are both wearing glasses. Everybody at Glastonbury likes wearing comfortable clothes and shoes. Some people at the back are sitting on the grass and others are walking. I remember this was the first day of the festival, it lasts five days!"

That day, everybody in my city is preparing food, flowers and other offerings for their loved ones who have died. We believe they visit us on this day and that is the reason why we offer them things. Many of us like to put on special clothes and wear makeup on our faces. In the picture you can see me with my boyfriend, Marcos. We are kissing! Marcos is wearing a mariachi suit and I am wearing a wedding dress. Next to Marcos, there is Antonio who is our friend. He is wearing typical Mexican clothes and Day of the Dead makeup. It is strange for many people that we are so happy and festive this day. Many people are sad when they visit the cemetery but we are not! There is music and colors everywhere."
